# `liblux`

## Overview

`liblux` is a minimal C library (C++ compatible) for interacting with screen
brightness levels on Linux systems.  The library offers a simple to use and well
documented API for getting and setting screen brightness using both raw values
and percentages.

## Compilation

Compilation of the library is extremely simple, but will require you to have the
`tup` build system installed:

```
$ tup           # To build the library
# make install  # To install the library, requires root privileges
```

After compilation and installation, you will be able to build programs using the
`liblux` library that are dynamically or statically linked.

## Documentation

All library functions are documented via manual pages.  After installing the
library using the above commands, the manual pages will be installed on your
system and youâ€™ll be able to read the documentation using the `man` command as
such:

```
$ man luxget  # To view documentation for the luxget(3) function
```

If you prefer to view documentation in your browser (why?), all manuals are also
available over at [my website][1].  [Here][2] is the link to view the manual
providing an overview of the entire library, for example.
