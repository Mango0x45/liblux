.Sh NAME
.Nm lux.h
.Nd query and manipulate screen brightness
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In lux.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm liblux
library is a C library
.Pq C++ compatible
that allows you to query information about and modify the state of the systems
display brightness.
The library defines a
.Vt struct luxdisp
type which is used as an argument to all the library functions.
This struct contains relevant file descriptors and other cacheable information;
itâ€™s fields are not intended to be accessed directly by the library user but
only by library functions.
.Pp
The
.Nm liblux
library offers three sets of functions, each with their own manual.
These sets of functions are used to allocate and free the
.Vt struct luxdisp
structure, to query brightness information, and to modify brightness
information.
.Pp
The following functions deal with the allocation of library structures:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Ft int
.Fn luxinit "struct luxdisp *"
.It
.Ft void
.Fn luxfree "struct luxdisp *"
.El
.Pp
The following functions deal with querying information regarding display
brightness:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Ft int
.Fn luxget "struct luxdisp *"
.It
.Ft int
.Fn luxmax "struct luxdisp *"
.It
.Ft double
.Fn luxgetp "struct luxdisp *"
.El
.Pp
The following functions deal with modifying display brightness:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Ft int
.Fn luxset "struct luxdisp *" int
.It
.Ft int
.Fn luxinc "struct luxdisp *" int
.It
.Ft int
.Fn luxdec "struct luxdisp *" int
.It
.Ft double
.Fn luxsetp "struct luxdisp *" double
.It
.Ft double
.Fn luxincp "struct luxdisp *" double
.It
.Ft double
.Fn luxdecp "struct luxdisp *" double
.El
